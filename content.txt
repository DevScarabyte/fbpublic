+ Test <br>After next restart, To get better feedback, I am going to be testing an upgraded detector and anomaly system. <br>This will require download of two small mods. It may take a few minutes for third party launchers to update with new mods.<br>During this test, the city of Cherno will become a dynamic zone for Anomalies, which is much different than the ones I have chosen to be around the map so far in places related to the lore.<br>Please be careful, but I am eager to see what sort of things people run into. <br><br>New locations and lore patch, as well as the updated map for the month will be done shortly.<br><br>+ Changes<br>Small changes to pre storm to attempt time between whispers and the storm blowout to be closer together.<br>Small adjustments to exisitng story related anomalies to make them slightly more common for people to find.<br>
