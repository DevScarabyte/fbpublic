Frostbite Fixes Update <br/>- Added Tendency to Cold Resistance. Should show a visual how fast you are gaining resistance base on your heat and gear.<br/> Frostbite HP loss capped at 25%. So having multiple slots of frostbite won't count towards this any more. <br/> Feet, Hands, and Mask were adjusted to take longer to get frostbite. <br/> Once cured of frostbite you will never be able to get frostbite again until death. So don't die.<br/>
