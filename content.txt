Frostbite never dies, don't give up hope my friends! <br/>
Due to issues with my internet I have been unable to post updates or get into my discord on my PC. <br/>
I unfortunately am locked out on my phone as the backup codes are not working.
I have been working on mods and everything under the sun in offline mode this whole time if that message wasn't clear enough. 
Thanks to all the survivors out there who haven't given up just because of a few weeks with no updates, we greatly appreciate it.
Enjoy the summer Survivors!
