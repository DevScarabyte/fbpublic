Emission Update <br/>- Part 1 of 2 of update, Complete rework of Emission symptom scripts and updating RPCs to new system.  <br/> Adjustments to Skyboxes, fog during snowstorms, and other tweaks <br/> Changes to Emission effects on player: Emissions will no longer do damage per tick, it will now deal repeated shock damage while exposed, allowing movement between safety but only for short times. <br/> If you become unconcious during the storm due to being careless, you will go uncon and not wake up until the end of the storm, thus being vulnerable to players or infected. <br/> More changes on the way to make the sounds during an emission more immersive, add a "madness" sickness that will have interesting effects at various stages, depending on overall exposure to the emission, from vomiting, to comlpetely losing your mind. <br/> Stay Tuned and thanks for playing on Frostbite!
